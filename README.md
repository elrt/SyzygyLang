# Syzygy Language

**Algebraic Programming for Mathematical Computation**

Syzygy is a domain-specific language that treats programs as systems of algebraic constraints. It's designed for mathematicians, researchers, and developers working with abstract algebra, category theory, and mathematical structures.

##  Why Syzygy?

Traditional programming languages struggle with mathematical abstractions. Syzygy bridges this gap by providing native support for:

- **Ring Theory** - Finite fields, rational numbers, modular arithmetic
- **Module Theory** - Free modules, generators, algebraic relations  
- **Category Theory** - Morphisms, limits, universal properties
- **Constraint Solving** - Algebraic relation resolution

##  Quick Example

```
// Define algebraic structures
ring Z5 = integers_mod 5
module V = free_module(Z5, 3)

// Declare generators and relations
generators {
    v1 = (1, 0, 0) in V
    v2 = (0, 1, 0) in V
}

relations {
    2*v1 + 3*v2 == 0
}

// Functional programming with pattern matching
define factorial as n .
    case n of {
        0 -> 1;
        _ -> n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Algebraic-First Design**
```
// Rings are first-class citizens
ring Z7 = integers_mod 7
ring Q = rationals

// Modules over rings
module VectorSpace = free_module(Q, 3)
module MatrixAlgebra = free_module(Z7, 9)
```

### 2. **Constraint-Based Programming**
```
relations {
    3*x + 2*y == z                    // Linear relations
    kernel(f) == image(g)             // Exact sequences  
    composition(m1, m2) == identity   // Morphism properties
}
```

### 3. **Mathematical Pattern Matching**
```
case matrix of {
    ((a, b), (c, d)) -> a*d - b*c     // Determinant
    _ -> 0
}
```

## Compiler Architecture

```
Lexer → Parser → Algebraic Constraint Solver → Code Generator
```

**Built with safety in mind:**
- Memory-safe C implementation
- Bounds checking on all operations
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Modular, extensible design

## Use Cases

### Research Mathematics
- Formal verification of algebraic proofs
- Experimentation with mathematical structures
- Educational tool for abstract algebra

### Scientific Computing
- Cryptographic protocol analysis
- Computational algebraic geometry
- Linear algebra over finite fields

### Education
- Teaching abstract algebra concepts
- Visualizing mathematical structures
- Interactive mathematical exploration


## What Makes Syzygy Unique?

### **Not Just Another DSL**
While other mathematical languages focus on theorem proving or numerical computation, Syzygy specializes in **algebraic structure manipulation** and **constraint resolution**.
